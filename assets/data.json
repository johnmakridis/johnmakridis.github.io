I have been dealing with computer science for the last eight years and I have developed the set of skills required to offer customized solutions to enterprises and individuals, aiming to fully meet their daily needs with intelligent and automated systems.",
    "short_bio": "<p class='align-justify'>I was born on December 2, 1991 in Patras, Greece and currently I live in the city of Heraklion Crete, Greece. At the age of 17 I made my first steps in computer science by learning the basics on the computer architecture, data structures, databases and programming. In 2010, after my graduation from high school, I started my university studies at <a href='http://hmu.gr' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Technological Educational Institute of Crete</a> where I received the BSc degree in Information Systems from the <a href='https://www.hmu.gr/mst/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Department of Business Planning and Information Systems</a>. </p> <p class='align-justify'>In 2016, I started my postgraduate studies at the <a href='https://www.hmu.gr/ece' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> of Helenic Mediterranean University and I received the MSc degree in Informatics and Multimedia with specialization in Software Technology and Applications in early 2018.</p> <p class='align-justify'> Since May 2016, I am Research Associate of the research laboratory <a href='http://www.e-bilab.gr/en/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>e-Business Intelligence Lab</a> of HMU. My research interests are focused on areas such as web programming & technologies, data analytics, business intelligence and machine learning. </p> <p class='align-justify'>Today I'm working as software developer specialized in analysis, design and development of web applications and information systems. Currently, I’m working as a front-end developer at <a href='http://mentionlytics.com' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Mentionlytics LTD</a>.

      "abstract": "The evolution of ontologies is a reality in current research community. The problem of understanding and exploring this evolution is a fundamental problem as maintainers of depending artifacts need to take a decision about possible changes and ontology engineers need to understand the reasons for this evolution. Recent research focuses on identifying and statically visualizing deltas between ontology versions using various low- or high-level language of changes. In this paper, we argue that this is not enough and we provide a complete solution enabling the active, dynamic exploration of the evolution of RDF/S ontologies using provenance queries. To this direction, we construct an ontology of changes for modeling the language of changes and we store all changes as instances of this ontology in a triple store. On top of this triple store two visualization modules, one individual app and one protégé plugin allow the exploration of the evolution using provenance queries. To the best of our knowledge our approach is unique in allowing the dynamic exploration of the evolution using provenance queries.",

      "abstract": "Current research argues that eLearning and mobile learning are forms of learning that could take place outside the classroom and the traditional learning environments. In addition, recent advancement in technology and increased use of smart devices permit students to carry with them a kind of portable smart device. Inevitably, sooner or later, these devices will become integral educational tools, such as pencils and books, while learning outside the classroom will continue to gain popularity as another form of learning. Ubiquitous learning aims to stimulate the wide use of ICT in Education and the enactment of autonomous digital resources for Outdoor learning. Technology could provide innovative ways of conducting outdoor courses, encompassing knowledge and physical activity. This paper presents the eClass-Pi system that facilitates outside the classroom eLearning and m-learning educational processes. It provides all the functionalities of a typical Learning Management Systems as well as synchronous and asynchronous teaching, portability and energy autonomy.",

      "abstract": "Current research argues that the use of social networks can be a dominant resource for acquiring valuable knowledge about tourist destinations through the collection of data from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN). This approach can provide solutions to problems and significant benefits to enterprises and local authorities. One of the most important problems is the lack of knowledge about the visitor's opinion for a destination, as well as the fact that the visitors' behavior, needs and preferences are not visible. Nowadays, enterprises and local authorities are still using the traditional method for acquiring valuable knowledge to make strategic decisions, using data from surveys conducted using questionnaires. In this process, despite the benefits it can offer, it can be observed that it is not continuous, it is not adaptable, and the number of the participants in most of the cases is quite small compared to the total number of visitors. This thesis presents the methodology for extraction, association, analysis and visualization of data derived from Location-Based Social Networks, providing valuable knowledge about visitors’ behavior, impressions and preferences for tourist destinations. In that context, using a case study of the region of Crete (Greece) as tourist destination the overall insights of visitors are identified. Utilizing state of the art web technologies for the development of this monitoring framework, we will collect publicly available social data for the selected tourism destinations. Some of the data that need to be collected for the process of analysis are the visitors’ posts and reviews, publication’s date and time, published photos, places’ rankings, user’s profile, nationality and engagement. After the completion of data collection, the correlation and analysis are followed, presenting data visualization in a proper and efficient way to the stakeholders. Having acquired this valuable knowledge about the visitors’ behavior and preferences, the stakeholders such as local authorities, enterprises etc. can make a more efficient promotion of tourist destinations based on the needs of visitors, improvement of the existing facilities and creation of new experiences attracting the interest of more potential visitors.",
