    "short_bio": "<p class='align-justify'>I was born on December 2, 1991 in Patras, Greece and currently I live in the city of Heraklion Crete, Greece. At the age of 17 I made my first steps in computer science by learning the basics on the computer architecture, data structures, databases and programming. In 2010, after my graduation from high school, I started my university studies at <a href='http://hmu.gr' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Technological Educational Institute of Crete</a> where I received the BSc degree in Information Systems from the <a href='https://www.hmu.gr/mst/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Department of Business Planning and Information Systems</a>. </p> <p class='align-justify'>In 2016, I started my postgraduate studies at the <a href='https://www.hmu.gr/ece' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> of Helenic Mediterranean University and I received the MSc degree in Informatics and Multimedia with specialization in Software Technology and Applications in early 2018.</p> <p class='align-justify'> Since May 2016, I am Lab Associate of the research laboratory <a href='http://www.e-bilab.gr/en/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>e-Business Intelligence Lab</a> of HMU.

      "abstract": "The evolution of ontologies is a reality in current research community. The problem of understanding and exploring this evolution is a fundamental problem as maintainers of depending artifacts need to take a decision about possible changes and ontology engineers need to understand the reasons for this evolution. Recent research focuses on identifying and statically visualizing deltas between ontology versions using various low- or high-level language of changes. In this paper, we argue that this is not enough and we provide a complete solution enabling the active, dynamic exploration of the evolution of RDF/S ontologies using provenance queries. To this direction, we construct an ontology of changes for modeling the language of changes and we store all changes as instances of this ontology in a triple store. On top of this triple store two visualization modules, one individual app and one protégé plugin allow the exploration of the evolution using provenance queries. To the best of our knowledge our approach is unique in allowing the dynamic exploration of the evolution using provenance queries.",

      "abstract": "Current research argues that eLearning and mobile learning are forms of learning that could take place outside the classroom and the traditional learning environments. In addition, recent advancement in technology and increased use of smart devices permit students to carry with them a kind of portable smart device. Inevitably, sooner or later, these devices will become integral educational tools, such as pencils and books, while learning outside the classroom will continue to gain popularity as another form of learning. Ubiquitous learning aims to stimulate the wide use of ICT in Education and the enactment of autonomous digital resources for Outdoor learning. Technology could provide innovative ways of conducting outdoor courses, encompassing knowledge and physical activity. This paper presents the eClass-Pi system that facilitates outside the classroom eLearning and m-learning educational processes. It provides all the functionalities of a typical Learning Management Systems as well as synchronous and asynchronous teaching, portability and energy autonomy.",

      "abstract": "Current research argues that the use of social networks can be a dominant resource for acquiring valuable knowledge about tourist destinations through the collection of data from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN). This approach can provide solutions to problems and significant benefits to enterprises and local authorities. One of the most important problems is the lack of knowledge about the visitor's opinion for a destination, as well as the fact that the visitors' behavior, needs and preferences are not visible. Nowadays, enterprises and local authorities are still using the traditional method for acquiring valuable knowledge to make strategic decisions, using data from surveys conducted using questionnaires. In this process, despite the benefits it can offer, it can be observed that it is not continuous, it is not adaptable, and the number of the participants in most of the cases is quite small compared to the total number of visitors. This thesis presents the methodology for extraction, association, analysis and visualization of data derived from Location-Based Social Networks, providing valuable knowledge about visitors’ behavior, impressions and preferences for tourist destinations. In that context, using a case study of the region of Crete (Greece) as tourist destination the overall insights of visitors are identified. Utilizing state of the art web technologies for the development of this monitoring framework, we will collect publicly available social data for the selected tourism destinations. Some of the data that need to be collected for the process of analysis are the visitors’ posts and reviews, publication’s date and time, published photos, places’ rankings, user’s profile, nationality and engagement. After the completion of data collection, the correlation and analysis are followed, presenting data visualization in a proper and efficient way to the stakeholders. Having acquired this valuable knowledge about the visitors’ behavior and preferences, the stakeholders such as local authorities, enterprises etc. can make a more efficient promotion of tourist destinations based on the needs of visitors, improvement of the existing facilities and creation of new experiences attracting the interest of more potential visitors.",

A major problem is the lack of knowledge in respect to the visitors’ views about a destination, as well as the fact that the visitors’ behavior needs and preferences are not visible. Many enterprises and local authorities are still using traditional methods for acquiring knowledge to make strategic decisions, by collecting data from questionnaires. Nonetheless, this process, despite its benefits, is short-lived and the number of the participants is small compared to the number of visitors. This chapter discusses a methodology for the extraction, association, analysis, and visualization of data derived from LBSNs. This provides knowledge of visitor behaviors, impressions and preferences for tourist destinations. A case study of Crete in Greece is included, based upon visitors’ posts and reviews, nationality, photos, place rankings, and engagement.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, local authorities and tourism enterprises are using conventional methods like surveys and opinion polls for collecting data and strategic decision making. Despite the benefits of these approaches, they present significant disadvantages such as time-consuming and sample size. This research paper investigates the user-generated data in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) that can be a great resource of knowledge for understanding people’s behavior details and movement flows in tourism destinations. Focusing on tourism and location-based social media networks, this research reveals a novel approach to leverage massive unstructured data for knowledge extraction. In contrast to the conventional spatio-temporal data, big social media data offer dynamically to innovation and value creation through improving the strategic decision-making process of tourism destination stakeholders. The approach integrates location and big data analytics techniques and it is implemented based upon geotagged user-generated data shared on the two largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the island of Crete (Greece), and the island of Cyprus that are popular summertime tourist destinations. The comparison between two tourist destinations with common characteristics provides additional insights into the potential of each destination and areas of improvement. Practical implications are arising through the efficient spatio-temporal and demographic analysis of tourist movement in both tourism destinations for improving the strategic decision making of stakeholders like local authorities and tourism SMEs leading to innovation and value creation. In addition, DMOs can leverage the new knowledge for developing innovative marketing strategies, strengthening destination branding, and gaining a competitive advantage against rival tourism destinations.",

      "abstract": "In Europe, it is estimated that households are responsible for the largest portion of foodwaste generation, which contributes up to 16% of the CO2 emissions of the food supplychain. Major reasons for household food waste generation are food spoilage, date labelconfusion, overbuying, and poor shopping planning (Gunders, 2017). Thus, food-wasteprevention  at  the  household  level  is  largely  an  issue  of  optimizing  food  resourcesmonitoring. Here we address this issue by designing and launching a decision supporttool implemented in a smart phone application, the FoodSaveShare App. FoodSaveSharecombines data from user input and supermarket loyalty schemes to take advantage oftheir combined shopping tracking features. The App features a shopping list functionalitythat allows either selection from a list of over 14,000 products as well as product barcodescanning and manual entry, and subsequent crossing-out during shopping. Shopping listsare linked with the loyalty account, thus allowing household members to create and sharecommon lists. After purchase, tips are provided about optimal storage of purchased fooditems.  Food  products  are  assigned  approximate  expiration  dates  based  on  food  andpackaging type, drawing from a list of 597 possible types. Notifications offer remindersabout  eminent  expiration  dates  and  provide  suggestions  about  the  utilization  of  fooditems that are about to expire or are on the shelf, drawing from a list of over 7,000recipes.  Additional  functionality  allows  users  to  identify  products  that  have  beenconsumed  in  time  or  had  to  be  discarded.  Statistics  such  as  purchase  history  andresources  spent  versus  resources  saved  allow  for  a  better  overview  and  provideincentives  for  better  shopping  and  consumption  habits.  The  FoodSaveShare  App  waslaunched  during  the  A2UFood  Project  (Chroni  et  al.,  2019)  that  includes  food  wasteprevention actions at the household level. The App has been tested under real customerdata and conditions and is scheduled to be adopted by the largest supermarket franchiseof the Island of Crete, Greece.",

      "abstract": "It is estimated that European households are responsible for 55% of food waste generation. Key factors contributing to household food waste generation include food spoilage, confusion over expiration dates, overbuying, and inadequate shopping planning. Thus, food waste prevention at the household level depends heavily on food supplies monitoring and management. To this end, during the last decade, several consumer-oriented digital tools have been designed and launched. A literature review showed that currently accessible digital tools are scarce and cover a narrow range of functionalities. Here, we address these issues by designing and launching a decision support tool implemented in a smart mobile phone application (app), the FoodSaveShare Mobile App. The application development followed a traditional client–server architecture using state-of-the-art software and hardware technologies. Additionally, a survey of 340 individuals was conducted to better understand end-user motivation for and barriers against adopting this and similar apps. The developed application combines user-provided data with a retailer loyalty program to leverage the integrated features for tracking shopping activities. The app features a household shopping list populated by product barcode scanning and manual entry. Based on food and packaging type, food products are assigned approximate expiration dates to issue product expiration reminders. For products about to expire, suggestions for their utilization are provided, drawing from a list of over 7000 recipes. Additional functionality allows users to identify products that have either been consumed in time or that need to be discarded. Analytical tools, such as past purchase and resources discarded versus resources saved statistics, offer comprehensive insight and encourage improved shopping and consumption practices. The FoodSaveShare App was launched during the A2UFood Project, which allowed an organised campaign for its use. The app was tested under real customer data and conditions, and selected features have been adopted by the largest supermarket chain on the Island of Crete, Greece. The potential end-user survey results suggest that, provided personal data use issues are addressed, such apps can have a significant impact on reducing household food waste. Future work will focus on analysing the datasets produced by the application to assess its impact on household food waste management.",
